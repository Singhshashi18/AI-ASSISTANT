    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems.
    These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
    
    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance
    without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to discover patterns in data.
    
    Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process data and extract features.
    Large Language Models like GPT, Gemini, and others can understand and generate human language.
    
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on human-computer interaction through language.
    It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate meaningful text and speech.
    
    These technologies power modern applications including:
    - Virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
    - Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)
    - Autonomous vehicles
    - Medical diagnosis tools
    - Language translation services
